             There aren't enough food, service, value or atmosphere ratings for Pappu Ka Dhaba, India yet. Be one of

                This place is more of a combination of all sorts of Restaurants. It is a huge place catering to the
                taste buds of all categories. For quick bites, you can try fast food such as Poha, Bhajji etc. It has AC
                restaurants inside the premises. It has reasonable parking. The washrooms are OK, but needs lot of
                improvement. The Highway Retreat is a better option, which is a little away form this.
